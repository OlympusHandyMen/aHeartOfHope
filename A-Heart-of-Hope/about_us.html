			A Heart of Hope Foundation was founded by a group of people living in the United States and Lima, Peru. Awareness <br>
			of the violence that exists in this world (one of the founders was a victim of domestic abuse) touched our hearts and we <br>
			wanted to help these victims of abuse. We are aware of the immense need these people have for integral, fiscal, <br>
			intellectual, emotional, social, and professional help and support. A Heart of Hope Foundation is based out of Miami, Fl <br> 
			and is registered as a non profit organization 501(C)(3). All contributions received are tax deductible charitable <br> 
			donations. EIN: 47-3263632/ N15000001730. Violence against women and children is a crime against human dignity <br>
			and basic human rights. It is a tragedy that transcends all sectors of society and is not reliant on class, economic <br>
			status, culture, education level, age, race, ethnicity, or religion. Ending violence is essential for a good individual and <br> 
			social development and the full participation in all areas of life. That is why we cannot just be spectators, we must act in <br> 
			a constructive and positive way to help them exercise their rights and eliminate situations of violence that affect them <br>
			NEVER TIRE OF DOING GOOD!
