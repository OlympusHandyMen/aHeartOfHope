			<h3>Grief Psychotherapy Service</h3>

			<br>

			<h4>Our organization provides families with psychological, moral and spiritual support.<br>
			Among its different activities, we have a free Grief Psychotherapy Service for adults, adolescents and children <br>
			who have suffered the loss of a loved one and are going through mourning.<br>
			</h4>

			<br>

			If you have lost a loved one, it is possible for you to go through all kinds of emotions. You are likely to be sad, worried or <br>
			even scared. Maybe you were not prepared, and you feel quite confused by the loss. You may feel angry, guilty, <br>
			exhausted, or empty. Your emotions can be very confusing than normal, and you may have feelings you have never <br>
			experienced before. All these emotions are natural reactions to the death, loss of a loved one.<br>

			<br>
			
			You are going through a grieving process, which is the process that follows the loss of a loved one. This loss is <br>
			definitive, but you can also mourn for other life events that don’t involve the death of a love one, such as the rupture of <br>
			a relationship, illness, involuntary absence of a loved one, etc.<br>
			
			<br>

			Nobody is prepared for the loss of a loved one (parents, children, couples, siblings, etc.) we naturally lock ourselves in, <br>
			and lose interest in life; children are the most affected, they have many questions, that we can’t answer. The Heart of <br>
			Hope Foundation has a team of professionals to help these families free of charge. Part of the grieving process is to <br>
			recognize the pain that causes the loss of a loved one, however life goes on, and there are other members of the <br>
			family that still need us. We completely understand your pain.<br>

			<br>
			
			We are aware that going to a private professional is extremely expensive, at A Heart of Hope Foundation, we have <br>
			experienced it in our own flesh, we know what it feels like to go through that painful experience. We know that with the <br>
			help of God and the team of professionals, we can move forward with our lives. <br>

			<br>

			<h4>We are at your service, to give you comfort, love, and to help you restore your lives. A Heart of Hope Foundation! <br>
			Saving Lives, Restoring Families!<br>
			</h4>

			<br>

			A Heart of Hope International Foundation, a nonprofit organization, was created to bring  help to victims of domestic <br>
			abuse, holistically, physical, intellectually, emotionally, socially and professionally. Our mission is to impart knowledge <br>
			and principles that will restore and strengthen family relationships and to uplift victims of abuse into becoming useful <br>
			members of society. A Heart of Hope was created to equip women and their children with modern and effective tools, <br>
			where support is offered to women and their children who experience violence. We plan to set up a 24 hour hotline that <br>
			will provide counseling, legal advice and options to go to a shelter to find safety. This foundation aims to promote <br>
			growth and harmony in the family, providing care to women to promote a culture of non-violence and gender equality. In <br>
			the long term we plan to build a day center that will have classes and childcare available for women and their children. <br>
			Our after school program will help teach children of single mothers, not only basic life skills not commonly taugh in the <br>
			current school system (grooming, setting up a resume, cooking, cleaning, doing taxes, financial planning, etc) but will <br>
			also teach children to treat each other with kindness, respect, and empathy. Our goal is prevention. If a child grows up <br>
			in an abusive, mysoginistic home, that will be all he learns. At A Heart of Hope, we want to be the example of love, <br>
			respect, and compassion that every child should have growing up. Our day center will also be a place, like our hotline, <br>
			where women can come to find legal advice, counseling, and overall support in times of need. We will have various <br>
			classes available for women that will teach them job skills, resume building, interview skills, self worth, money <br>
			management, to help them get out of abusive codependent situations and feel confident enough to thrive on their own.
