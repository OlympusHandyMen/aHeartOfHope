			<h3>If you are in danger, please call 911,  or the U.S. National Domestic Violence<br>
			Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224.</h3><br>

			In countries all around the world, millions of women and girls are beaten by their partners, subjected to forced sex or <br>
			genital mutilation or killed for reasons of honor. During conflict, violence against women appears in many ways. <br>
			Violence against women and girls is not limited to any political or economic system in particular, but is prevalent in every <br>
			society in the world. It knows no racial boundaries, it is not cultural or economic. It is an expression of values and <br>
			historical and culturally specific rules still applied by many social and political institutions that encourage submission <br>
			and discrimination against women and girls. Women in urban areas are twice as likely as men to suffer some kind of <br>
			violence, especially in developing countries. One of the side effects of this situation is that, culturally, victims tend to be <br>
			"found guilty" of their situation no matter what tragedies they endured. The United Nations Commission notes that at <br>
			least one in three women and girls have been assaulted physically or sexually abused in her lifetime. 45% to 60% of <br>
			homicides against women occur in their own home and most are committed by their spouses. Violence is the leading <br>
			cause of death for women between 15 and 44 years, more than cancer and traffic accidents. Globally, it is estimated <br>
			that at least 1 in 3 women has been beaten, coerced into sex or suffered other abuses by some this man in their life. <br>
			Fear and shame continue to prevent many women from reporting violence and therefore the data collected is inconsistent. <br>
			Violence against women devastates lives, fractures communities, and stalls development. Women are a <br>
			vital part of our society. Every six hours the murder of a woman in Mexico occurs. In Peru according to the <br>
			Demographic and Health Survey (ENDES) 2013 INEI, 71.5% of women have endured violence from their partner.<br>
			35.7% was affected by physical violence, 8.4% by violence sexual and 67.5% for psychological or verbal violence. <br>
			Statistics of violence in the US A woman is attacked by her partner every 15 seconds. A woman is raped every six minutes. <br>
			Over 50% of women are beaten once in her life; more than a third are repeatedly beaten every year. The <br>
			evidence of the percentage of physical violence in premarital sex is 20 to 35%. 30% of female homicide victims were <br>
			killed by their husbands or boyfriends. 95% of domestic violence police reports refer to men who have beaten their <br>
			wives ... 9 out of l0 murdered women were killed by men ... 4 out of 5 murders occur at home. The main cause of death <br>
			for pregnant women in the US is murder, according to a study in Maryland. The second cause of death was a heart <br>
			attack. One in five deaths of pregnant women was a result of a violent attack, usually perpetrated by an intimate <br>
			partner. Intimate partner abuse cause more harm to the mother and her child than pregnancy related medical <br>
			problems.. ("Murder is biggest cause of death in pregnancy", March 21, 2001, <br>
			<a href="www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Health/2001-03/death210301.shtml">www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Health/2001-03/death210301.shtml</a>) Homicide is the leading cause of death for <br>
			women in the place where they work; Husbands or intimate partners commit 13,000 acts of violence against their <br>
			partners each year. (American Institute on Domestic Violence Statistics, <a href="www.aidv-usa.com/Statistics.htm">www.aidv-usa.com/Statistics.htm.</a>) The divorces <br>
			that occur each year, demonstrate the lack of knowledge that our people have  on how to conduct their marital <br>
			relationships. Often times women are abandoned by their spouses and left to fend for themselves. These women often <br>
			do not understand the basic principles of interacting with their children and how to raise them with moral values to <br>
			achieve personal success. These women often don't have a profession or knowledge to perform a job to provide for <br>
			themselves and their children. There are different ways through which an abuser tries to control their partner, but most <br>
			are in one of four categories: Physical Violence: including hitting, slapping, pushing, kicking, squeezing, etc. and often <br>
			the abuse leads to suicide. Emotional violence: constantly criticizing, offensive nicknames, threatening, isolating the <br>
			woman from her family or friends, are all control techniques used by an abuser Economic Violence:  forbidding a <br>
			woman to work, taking her money, administering her money or monitoring her expenses. Sexual Violence: An abuser <br>
			may force women to have sex or engage in practices that women do not want to demonstrate their control. No woman <br>
			should feel pressured to do anything she does not feel comfortable with. All these actions are controlled by the abuser, <br>
			leaving children traumatized by their experience with their parents. which leads to the breakdown of families. When a <br>
			woman is forced to modify her behavior for fear of the reaction of her partner, then she is being abused and controlled. <br>
			A child that comes from an abusive home, due to lack of love and attention from their parents, often turn to drugs, <br>
			alcohol, pornography, prostitution etc. Stop the cycle of abuse! It is not too late to make a change. <br>
