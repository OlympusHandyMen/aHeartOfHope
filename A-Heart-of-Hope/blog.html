			<h3>Why a Heart of Hope</h3>

		Countless people have lost their lives to domestic violence crimes in the United States – not only intimate partners, but <br>
		their children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, aunts, uncles, friends, neighbors, new partners, and co-<br>
		workers. Countless more have been injured – many critically. Most recover – some from devastating injuries. Some <br>
		must deal with life-long injuries, such as disfigurement, paralyzation, or brain injuries. Some live, but do not, and will <br>
		not, recover from their injuries. Many more lives are ravaged by other forms of abuse. This epidemic is far worse than <br>
		most people realize. <br>
		There is much work to be done when it comes to domestic violence. Victims need to know how to recognize abuse and<br>
		how to get out safety, potential victims need to be knowledgeable about abuse in order to prevent themselves from <br>
		becoming victimized, and many survivors need knowledge and support to start over. But awareness efforts cannot <br> 
		stop there. We must also raise awareness about our system’s successes and failures and urge the public to demand <br>
		higher standards of our more than 20,000 separate justice systems in the U.S., which includes thousands upon <br>
		thousands of lawmakers, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, magistrates, court clerks, corrections <br>
		personnel, emergency/911/dispatch, medical professionals, advocates, and others across the United States. The sad <br>
		truth is that there are very few experts on domestic violence in our systems. Systems in some communities do not <br>
		have even one expert on domestic violence. As a result, we are seeing the same mistakes being made over and over <br>
		and over again across the United States.<br>
		There are a number of programs that our communities could be, and should be, using to stem the tide of domestic <br>
		violence. There are Coordinated Community Response programs, Lethality assessment programs, domestic violence<br>
		training programs, Bystander Intervention programs, Domestic violence and dating violence educational programs, <br>
		Batterer’s Intervention programs, and Family Justice Centers, to name just a few. We need EVERY community in the <br>
		United States to become proactive in their response to domestic violence. This is no easy task given that our system is <br>
		so fractured. There are more than 3,000 counties; more than 20,000 law enforcement agencies and as many courts<br>
		all operating independently of one another – with their own policies and their own staff who may or may not be<br>
		knowledgeable about domestic violence.<br>

		A Heart of Hope Foundation is building an awareness campaign that will make it impossible for people to continue <br>
		to ignore, minimize or deny just how deadly domestic violence can be. We are working on educating not only the system, <br>
		but the public, about what their communities could be, and should be, doing to curb domestic violence. It’s time we<br>
		demand much higher standards from our taxpayer-funded public services. <br>
		If we don’t learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to keep repeating them, and people will continue to die in large <br>
		numbers.<br>
